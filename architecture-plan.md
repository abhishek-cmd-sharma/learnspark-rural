## 3. Data Flow Patterns

### 3.1 User Authentication Flow
1. User accesses application through web or mobile client
2. Client requests authentication through Firebase Auth
3. Firebase Auth validates credentials and returns authentication token
4. Client fetches user profile from Firestore
5. Application loads appropriate dashboard based on user role

### 3.2 Learning Content Delivery Flow
1. Student navigates to a subject or lesson
2. Client requests content from Firestore
3. Firestore returns lesson content and associated resources
4. Client renders content with interactive elements
5. Student interactions are saved to progress tracking collections

### 3.3 Assessment and Grading Flow
1. Student initiates a quiz or assignment
2. Client retrieves assessment content from Firestore
3. Student completes assessment with real-time validation
4. Results are submitted to Cloud Functions for processing
5. Cloud Functions calculate scores and update progress collections
6. Teachers can access grading information through analytics dashboard

### 3.4 Progress Tracking Flow
1. System continuously monitors user interactions and completions
2. Progress data is aggregated and stored in Firestore
3. Analytics services process data to generate insights
4. Dashboards display visual representations of progress
5. Notifications are triggered based on milestones and achievements

## 4. Integration Points with Firebase Services
