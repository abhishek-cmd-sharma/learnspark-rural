import { QuizAssignmentTracker } from "@/components/QuizAssignmentTracker";
import { EducatorReports } from "@/components/EducatorReports";
```

2. Use the components in your dashboard layout:

  <TabsContent value="overview">
    <TeacherAnalyticsDashboard />
    <StudentProgressTracker students={students} />
  </TabsContent>
  
  <TabsContent value="analytics">
    <QuizAnalytics subjectId={currentSubjectId} />

    <QuizAssignmentTracker subjectId={currentSubjectId} />
  </TabsContent>
  
  <TabsContent value="reports">
    <EducatorReports />
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>
```

### Student Dashboard Integration

To integrate the student components:

1. Import the components:
```tsx
import { StudentProgressVisualization } from "@/components/StudentProgressVisualization";
import { RealTimeFeedback } from "@/components/RealTimeFeedback";
```

2. Use in the student dashboard:
```tsx
<div className="space-y-6">
 <StudentProgressVisualization />
  
  {/* In quiz interface */}
 <RealTimeFeedback 
    currentQuestionIndex={currentQuestionIndex}
    totalQuestions={totalQuestions}
    isCorrect={isCorrect}
    timeTaken={timeTaken}
    streakCount={streakCount}
  />
</div>
```

## Component APIs

  totalQuestions: number;
  isCorrect?: boolean;
  timeTaken?: number;
  streakCount?: number;
  showEncouragement?: boolean;
}
```

### TeacherAnalyticsDashboard Props

## Data Requirements

These components rely on the existing Firestore context and data models defined in `src/lib/types.ts`. Ensure your Firestore collections include:

- `users` - User information
- `subjects` - Subject information
- `quizzes` - Quiz data
- `userQuizAttempts` - Student quiz attempts
- `achievements` - Achievement definitions
- `userAchievements` - User achievement progress

## Customization

Each component can be customized by modifying the styling classes or adjusting the data processing logic to match your specific requirements.

## Testing

To test these components:

1. Ensure your development server is running
2. Navigate to the teacher dashboard
3. Verify that all analytics components load correctly
4. Check that student progress tracking displays accurate data
5. Test quiz assignment functionality
6. Verify report generation and export features
7. Navigate to the student dashboard
8. Confirm progress visualization displays correctly
9. Test real-time feedback during quiz completion

## Troubleshooting

If components are not displaying data:

1. Verify Firestore context is properly initialized
2. Check that user authentication is working
3. Ensure required data collections exist in Firestore
4. Confirm network connectivity to Firebase
5. Check browser console for any error messages

If you encounter any issues, please refer to the existing components in the codebase for implementation examples.
